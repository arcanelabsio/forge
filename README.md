# Forge AI Assist

Forge installs a self-contained GitHub Copilot runtime under `~/.copilot` and runs Forge-managed GitHub Discussions workflows from there.

## Install

Run the installer:

```bash
npx forge-ai-assist@latest
```

This installs Forge globally into:

```bash
~/.copilot
```

Forge bootstraps:

- `~/.copilot/agents/forge-discussion-analyzer.agent.md`
- `~/.copilot/forge/dist/*`
- `~/.copilot/forge/node_modules/*`
- `~/.copilot/forge/bin/forge.mjs`
- `~/.copilot/forge/VERSION`
- `~/.copilot/forge/forge-file-manifest.json`

After installation, Copilot should discover:

- `forge-discussion-analyzer`

The bundled runtime entry used by installed agents is:

```bash
node "$HOME/.copilot/forge/bin/forge.mjs"
```

## Local Development

From this repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm link
forge
```

## Verify Install

Check the installed runtime:

```bash
ls ~/.copilot/agents
ls ~/.copilot/forge/bin
ls ~/.copilot/forge/node_modules
cat ~/.copilot/forge/VERSION
node "$HOME/.copilot/forge/bin/forge.mjs" --help
```

You should see `forge-discussion-analyzer.agent.md`, the bundled runtime entry at `~/.copilot/forge/bin/forge.mjs`, and a populated `~/.copilot/forge/node_modules` directory. Manual `npm install` inside `~/.copilot/forge` is not part of the supported flow.

## GitHub Discussions

Forge's discussions workflows require either `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

```bash
export GH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"
node "$HOME/.copilot/forge/bin/forge.mjs" --fetch-discussions --when today
node "$HOME/.copilot/forge/bin/forge.mjs" --run forge-discussion-analyzer --question "What recurring issues show up this week?"
```

In Copilot, `forge-discussion-analyzer` should route the request through Forge itself. The expected behavior is one approval for the Forge command path, then Forge handles fetch and analysis. It should not repair the bundled runtime or fall back to raw `gh api graphql` when Forge is available.

## Updating

To use the latest published version:

```bash
npx forge-ai-assist@latest
```

To confirm the installed CLI version:

```bash
node "$HOME/.copilot/forge/bin/forge.mjs" --version
```
