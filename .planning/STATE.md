## Audit Closure

Foundational milestone audit gaps have been addressed. Phase 1 requirements are now verified and traceable.
**Verification Evidence:** `.planning/phases/01-bootstrap-cli/01-VERIFICATION.md`

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 7 added: Installer simplification and GitHub discussions ingest
- Scope refinement: `npx forge-ai-assist@latest` should default to an interactive install flow, the published binary should be named `forge`, and GitHub Discussions ingest should persist discussion data into `.forge` for later assistant analysis.
- Scope refinement: the GitHub Discussions workflow must require `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` and support date/category filters such as `today`, `yesterday`, `last week`, `after`, and `before`.
- Phase 8 added: package the attached `gh-discussion-analyzer` behavior as a Forge-managed cross-assistant summonable named `forge-discussion-analyzer`.
- Scope refinement: Forge should own downloads, scripts, caching, and compact analysis context so assistant-installed assets stay lightweight while preserving high-quality discussion analysis.
- Phase 9 added: establish local-machine release management and a public one-command install path for Forge.
- Scope refinement: release builds and publishes should run from the maintainer's local machine for now, while installation must stay frictionless for any Node-capable system.
- Phase 9 completed: Forge now has publish-facing package metadata, packed-artifact install verification, a local `release:local` workflow, and maintainer/user release documentation.
- Phase 10 added: make the first-run installer succeed on fresh machines where the Copilot runtime layout does not exist yet.
- Scope refinement: v1 remains Copilot-first, but the installer must always install globally into `~/.copilot` and make that runtime self-sufficient instead of depending on a project-local Forge package.
- Phase 10 completed: Forge now installs a self-contained runtime under `~/.copilot`, writes bundled tools and installer metadata there, and installs Copilot agents that call the bundled runtime directly.
- Phase 11 added: remove runtime dependency prompts after install and tighten Copilot agent behavior so Forge stays the executor for discussion analysis.
- Scope refinement: the installed runtime should resolve its own dependencies during the initial `npx` install, and Copilot should seek approval once before letting Forge handle the full request.
- Scope refinement: the public Copilot install surface should only include `forge-discussion-analyzer`; the generic `forge-agent` asset should be removed.
- Phase 11 completed: Forge now bundles runtime dependencies into `~/.copilot/forge/node_modules`, installs only `forge-discussion-analyzer`, removes the legacy generic agent on reinstall, and documents the one-approval Forge-managed support model.

## Quick Tasks Completed
