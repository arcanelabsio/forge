# Releasing Forge

Forge releases currently run from the maintainer's local machine. There is no GitHub Actions publishing flow in Phase 9.

## Prerequisites

- Node 22 or newer
- `NPM_TOKEN` exported for non-interactive release, or local npm authentication available via `npm login`
- A clean git worktree, unless you intentionally override the check
- Release-ready package version already set in `package.json`

## Recommended Release Sequence

One-command release:

```bash
make release v1.0.0
```

This flow will:

- normalize the version (`v1.0.0` becomes `1.0.0`)
- update `package.json`
- verify git status
- prefer `NPM_TOKEN` for npm authentication
- start `npm login` automatically only when `NPM_TOKEN` is missing and npm auth is not already configured
- run build, test, and pack checks
- publish the verified tarball to npm

Dry-run release validation:

```bash
make release-check v1.0.0
```

Equivalent direct command:

```bash
npm run release:local -- v1.0.0 --publish
```

Recommended non-interactive setup:

```bash
export NPM_TOKEN=your_npm_token_here
make release v1.0.0
```

After npm publish, create the matching git tag and GitHub Release note:

```bash
make release-tag v1.0.0
```

## Optional Flags

- `make release v1.0.0 next --tag next` is not supported; use the direct npm command when you need extra flags
- `npm run release:local -- v1.0.0 --publish --tag next` publishes under a non-`latest` dist-tag
- `--otp 123456` if your npm account requires one-time passwords
- `--login never` disables automatic `npm login`
- `--login always` forces a fresh `npm login` before validation
- `--allow-dirty` only if you intentionally want to bypass the clean-worktree check
- `--keep-tarball` to retain the packed `.tgz` artifact after the command exits
- `--skip-version-bump` keeps the current `package.json` version unchanged

## After Publish

Recommended follow-up steps:

1. Run `make release-tag v1.0.0` for the published version
2. Verify public install and bundled Copilot runtime:

```bash
npx forge-ai-assist@latest
ls ~/.copilot/agents
ls ~/.copilot/forge/bin
ls ~/.copilot/forge/node_modules
node "$HOME/.copilot/forge/bin/forge.mjs" --version
```

Expected post-install state:

- `~/.copilot/agents/forge-discussion-analyzer.agent.md` exists
- `~/.copilot/forge/node_modules` exists and is populated
- `node "$HOME/.copilot/forge/bin/forge.mjs" --help` works immediately
- no manual `npm install` is required inside `~/.copilot/forge`
- the installed Copilot agent routes discussion analysis through Forge instead of raw `gh api graphql`

## Failure Handling

- If `NPM_TOKEN` is unset and `npm whoami` fails, the release script will try `npm login` unless you passed `--login never`
- If tests fail, do not publish; fix the issue and rerun the release command
- If publish succeeds but local cleanup fails, the release is already live; remove the tarball manually and proceed with tag/release-note cleanup
- If a target machine has only `~/.copilot/ide/*.lock`, rerunning `npx forge-ai-assist@latest` should still bootstrap `~/.copilot/agents` and `~/.copilot/forge`
- If you still see Copilot attempting `npm install` or raw `gh api graphql`, reinstall Forge and inspect the generated `~/.copilot/agents/forge-discussion-analyzer.agent.md` plus `~/.copilot/forge/node_modules`
